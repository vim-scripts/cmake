Simple syntax updates for CMake (www.cmake.org) syntax highlighting in Vim, to include new names added all the way to cmake v2.8.12

This script is only an after/syntax file and it still uses the syntax/cmake.vim file provided by Vim. Script only adds new language keywords and names to be highlighted.

Syntax changes:
   - new CMake commands
   - CMake-provided variables 
   - CMake properties
   - CMake "generator expressions"
